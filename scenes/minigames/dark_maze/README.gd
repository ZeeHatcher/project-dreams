"""
This is a note from AniMerrill about the art, you can discard this
once you have everything working

I made the following sprites for this game:
	* assets/daedelus.png
	* assets/maze_tiles.png
	* assets/minotaur.png

I created the following entities:
	* entities/daedelus.tscn
	* entities/minotaur.tscn

Both Daedelus (the player) and the Minotaur are just a sprite with an
AnimationPlayer you can control. They each have the following animations:
	* run_right
	* run_left
	* run_down
	* run_up

(Please note that the Minotaur says "run" but he walks considerably
slower in the animation)

Have fun.
